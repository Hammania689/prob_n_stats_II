"Probability and Statistical Inference, 9th edition" 
by Robert V. Hogg, Elliot A. Tanis,and Dale L. Zimmerman.
 
This "Data-R" folder includes the data for use with "R" or other 
programs for which the data are read in from an ASCII file. To 
minimize the amount of typing needed to obtain a data set, the data 
for each exercise and for each example are listed separately. They 
are named, e.g., E2_1-04 for Exercise 2.1-4 and Ex2_1-7 for 
Example 2.1-7. Each one of these files uses a 2-digit number for 
the exercise number. This was done for consistency. You should be 
able to open any of these data sets to check it out. Also, there 
are no column headers for these data. Many of the data sets that 
compare samples from two distributions are listed in two columns 
with the first column for the first data set and the second column 
for the second data set.
